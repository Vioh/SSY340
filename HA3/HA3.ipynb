    "\n",
    "1. Everything runs as expected (no bugs when running cells);\n",
    "2. The output from each cell corresponds to its code (don't change any cell's contents without rerunning it afterwards);\n",
    "3. All outputs are present (don't delete any of the outputs);\n",
    "4. Fill in all the places that say `# YOUR CODE HERE`, or \"**Your answer:** (fill in here)\".\n",
    "5. You should not need to create any new cells in the notebook, but feel free to do it if convenient for you.\n",
    "6. The notebook contains some hidden metadata which is important during our grading process. **Make sure not to corrupt any of this metadata!** The metadata may be corrupted if you perform an unsuccessful git merge / git pull. It may also be pruned completely if using Google Colab, so watch out for this. Searching for \"nbgrader\" when opening the notebook in a text editor should take you to the important metadata entries.\n",
    "7. Fill in your group number and the full names of the members in the cell below;\n",
    "8. Make sure that you are not running an old version of IPython (we provide you with a cell that checks this, make sure you can run it without errors).\n",
    "\n",
    "Failing to meet any of these requirements might lead to either a subtraction of POEs (at best) or a request for resubmission (at worst).\n",
    "\n",
    "We advise you the following steps before submission for ensuring that requirements 1, 2, and 3 are always met: **Restart the kernel** (in the menubar, select Kernel$\\rightarrow$Restart) and then **run all cells** (in the menubar, select Cell$\\rightarrow$Run All). This might require a bit of time, so plan ahead for this (and possibly use Google Cloud's GPU in HA1 and HA2 for this step). Finally press the \"Save and Checkout\" button before handing in, to make sure that all your changes are saved to this .ipynb file."

Since there are 6 steps in the optimal path (either by 10-5-0-1-2-3-4 or by 10-11-12-13-8-3-4), and since we have a discount factor of 0.9 at each step, so that result should be $0.9^6$ as stated."

Taking any other actions will be risky. For most cells in the bottom row, the policy is go west such that the agent can reach the green state by going through the top row. This is also reasonable, because state $S_8$ is located right next to the red state, so it's more dangerous this way. And even if the agent is smart enough to go west at state $S_8$ such that there is no chance of going to the red state, there is still 80% chance that the agent will be stuck at the same state in the next time step. Hence, we think it is a very good idea for the agent to try to go west at the bottom row."

    "**Your answer:** Informally, we can think of the discount factor $\\gamma$ as the \"ability to see the future\", since it controls how much the agent chooses to value the \"delayed reward\" over the \"immediate reward\". With the higher discount factor, the future gain diminishes slower with time, which means that the optimal policy will favor the longer path as long as it is safer to get the goal along this path. So suppose that the agent starts at the middle cell of the bottom row (state $S_{12}$). With $\\gamma = 0.99$, the agent is more careful and will choose to go west to reach the goal through the top row, despite the fact that this is the longer path. On the other hand, with $\\gamma = 0.9$, the agent takes more risks and will attempt to reach the goal by going east. "

    "The second reason is that Q-learning uses the action-value function $Q(s,a)$ to derive the policy instead of the state-value function $V(s)$. This is very important because acting $\\varepsilon$-greedily with respect to $V(s)$ requires the full knowledge of both the reward function and the state transition probability. This problem wouldn't arise if we instead keep a table that stores $Q(s,a)$, since deriving the $\\varepsilon$-greedy policy requires only the knowledge of the action-values (as shown in the next task 2.2). Of course, building up the table of $Q(s,a)$ itself requires both the reward and the action-values on the next state, but these can be observed from the environment while the agent is performing the episode."

    "# Task 3: Deep Double Q-learning (DDQN)\n",
    "For this task, you will implement a DDQN (double deep Q-learning network) to solve one of the problems of the OpenAI gym. Before we get into details about these type of networks, let's first review the simpler, DQN (deep Q-learning network) version. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Deep Q Networks\n",
    "As we saw in the video lectures, using a neural network as a state action value approximator is a great idea. However, if one tries to use this approach with Q-learning, it's very likely that the optimization will be very unstable. To remediate this, two main ideas are used. First, we use experience replay, in order to decorrelate the experience samples we obtain when exploring the environment. Second, we use two networks instead of one, in order to fix the optimization targets. That is, for a given minibatch sampled from the replay buffer, we'll optimize the weights of only one of the networks (commonly denoted as the \"online\" network), using the gradients w.r.t a loss function. This loss function is computed as the mean squared error between the current action values, computed according to the **online** network, and the temporal difference (TD) targets, computed using the other, **fixed network** (which we'll refer to as the \"target\" network).\n",
    "\n",
    "That is, the loss function is \n",
    "\n",
    "$$ L(\\theta) = \\frac{1}{N}\\sum_{i=1}^N \\left(Q(s_i,a_i; \\theta\\right) - Y_i)^2~,$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $N$ is the number of samples in your minibatch, $Q(s,a;\\theta)$ is the state action value estimate, according to the online network (with parameters $\\theta$), and $Y_t$ is the TD target, computed as\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ Y_i = r_i +  \\gamma ~\\underset{a}{\\text{max}}~Q(s_i', a; \\theta^-)~, $$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $Q(s', a;\\theta')$ is the action value estimate, according to the fixed network (with parameters $\\theta^-$).\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, so that the offline parameters are also updated, we periodically change the roles of the networks, fixing the online one, and training the other.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Double Deep Q Networks\n",
    "\n",
    "The idea explained above works well in practice, but later it was discovered that this approach is very prone to overestimating the state action values. The main reason for this is that the max operator, used to select the greedy action when computing the TD target, uses the same values both to select and to evaluate an action (this tends to prefer overestimated actions). In order to prevent this, we can decouple the selection from the evaluation, which is the idea that created DDQN. More concretely, the TD target for a DDQN is now \n",
    "\n",
    "$$ Y_i = r_i + \\gamma Q(s_i', \\underset{a}{\\text{argmax}}Q(s_i',a;\\theta); \\theta^-)~. $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Hence, we're using the **online** network to select which action is best, but we use the **fixed** network to evaluate the state action value for that chosen action in the next state. This is what makes DDQN not overestimate (as much) the state action values, which in turn helps us to train faster and obtain better policies.\n",

Name at least two solutions to the problem, and why it won't work without these changes. \n",

    "**Your answer:** Since each observation consists of only one screenshot of the current state, it is not possible for the agent to figure out what the velocity (speed/angle) and acceleration of the ball. The agent is thus unable to decide on a reasonable action based on the one screenshot alone. \n",
    "\n",
    "The first solution to solve this is to give the algorithm the current screenshot as well as the screenshot from the previous timestep. This will give the algorithm the possibility to calculate the velocity. The screenshots can simply be concatenated or merged together. By adding a third image so that the algorithm can see 3 consecutive screenshots, the algorithm can then also estimate the acceleration. \n",
    "\n",
    "The second solution is to also give the algorithm an optical flow filtered image in addition to the current screenshot. The optical flow filter contains information about the changes in the current screenshot from the previous screenshot, thus allowing the algorithm to use these information as well."
